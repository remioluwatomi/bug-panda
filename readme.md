   git clone https://github.com/remioluwatomi/bug-panda.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install

## 🔧 Development

### SCSS Structure

The SCSS is organized using a component-based architecture:

- `_base.scss`: Base styles, resets, and typography
- `_components.scss`: Reusable component styles
- `_variables.scss`: Global variables and theme settings
- `index.scss`: Main SCSS file that imports all partials

### Gulp Tasks

The project uses Gulp to automate the following tasks:

- SCSS compilation
- File watching
- CSS minification
- Browser auto-reload
